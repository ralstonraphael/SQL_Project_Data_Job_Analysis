# üìà The Analysis
Each query in this project targets a distinct dimension of the data analyst job market. Here's the methodology behind each investigation:

### **1. Top Paying Remote Data Analyst Jobs**
I filtered the job postings dataset for remote Data Analyst roles with valid salary data, then performed a LEFT JOIN with company information to preserve all matching records. The results were sorted by descending annual salary and limited to the top 10 highest-paying positions, extracting key fields including job details, compensation, and employer information.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,                  -- Unique identifier for each job posting
    job_title,               -- Official position title
    job_schedule_type,       -- Full-time/Part-time/Contract status
    salary_year_avg,         -- Annual compensation figure (key metric)
    job_posted_date,         -- When the position was listed
    name AS company_name     -- Employer offering the position
FROM
    job_postings_fact
-- Preserve all job postings while attaching company information
LEFT JOIN company_dim 
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND  -- Focus exclusively on Data Analyst roles
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND         -- Remote positions only
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL           -- Ensure salary data is available
-- Presentation logic:
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC                  -- Show highest salaries first
LIMIT 10;                                 -- Top 10 most lucrative opportunities
```

### **2. What skills do top-paying Data Analyst roles require?**
Using a CTE to isolate top-paying roles and subsequent joins with skills tables, this query maps salary benchmarks to specific technical requirements, showing the direct relationship between compensation and skill demand in data analytics

```sql
-- First, create a temporary result set of the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst jobs
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,               -- Unique identifier for each job posting
        job_title,            -- Official job title
        salary_year_avg,      -- Annual salary figure (our key metric)
        name AS company_name  -- Company offering the position
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    -- Include company names while preserving all job postings (LEFT JOIN)
    LEFT JOIN company_dim 
        ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND  -- Focus exclusively on Data Analyst roles
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND         -- Remote positions only
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL           -- Ensure salary data exists
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC                  -- Rank by salary (highest first)
    LIMIT 10                                  -- Get the top 10 highest-paying
)

-- Main query: Retrieve skills associated with these top-paying jobs
SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,        -- Include all columns from our CTE
    skills_dim.skills         -- Add the actual skill names
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
-- Connect to skills through two joins:
-- 1. Link jobs to skill IDs (via the junction table)
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
    ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
-- 2. Map skill IDs to human-readable skill names
INNER JOIN skills_dim 
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
-- Final presentation order (highest salary first)
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### **3. Which Skills are most in demand for Data Analysts?**
This query identifies and ranks the most in-demand skills for Data Analyst positions by: counting how often each skill appears in job postings, calculating its frequency as a percentage of all Data Analyst jobs, and standardizing the results on a 0-1 scale where 1 represents the most frequently required skill. It joins job posting data with skill information through bridge tables, filters for Data Analyst roles only, and returns the top 7 skills ordered by demand. The output provides both raw counts and normalized metrics to objectively compare skill importance.

```sql
-- Count how many job postings require each specific skill
WITH raw_counts AS (
    SELECT skills_dim.skills AS skill_name,
        -- Clean naming for readability
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count -- Total jobs requiring each skill
    FROM job_postings_fact
        /* Connection Path:
         1. Link job postings to skills through bridge table (skills_job_dim)
         2. Map skill IDs to actual skill names (skills_dim) */
        INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id -- Connect jobs to their skills
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id -- Get readable skill names
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' -- Focus specifically on Data Analyst roles
    GROUP BY skills_dim.skills -- Aggregate counts by each unique skill
),
total_jobs AS(
    -- Second CTE: Calculate total number of Data Analyst jobs for normalization
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT job_id) AS total
    FROM job_postings_fact
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
)
SELECT -- Main query: Combine raw counts with standardized metrics
    skill_name,
    demand_count,
    -- Percentage of all Data Analyst jobs that require this skill
    -- (Count of jobs with skill / Total jobs) * 100
    ROUND(
        demand_count * 100.0 / (
            SELECT total
            FROM total_jobs
        ),
        2
    ) AS frequency_percent,
    -- Standardized frequency (0-1 scale) where 1 = most demanded skill
    -- Current skill count / Count of most demanded skill
    ROUND(
        demand_count * 1.0 / (
            SELECT MAX(demand_count)
            FROM raw_counts
        ),
        3
    ) AS standardized_frequency
FROM raw_counts
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 7;
```

*Bubble chart showing the top 7 skills that show up the most frequently in job postings, as well as the percentage of times they show up in 2023.*

#### Key Insights  
- **SQL is Essential**: SQL appears in **47.12%** of Data Analyst job postings, making it the most critical skill. Its standardized frequency (1.0) sets the benchmark for all other skills.  
- **Specialization Gap**: While Python (29.16%) and Tableau (23.68%) are common, niche skills like SAS (14.28%) and R (15.30%) appear in fewer roles, highlighting optional vs. core competencies.  

### **4. What are the salary benchmarks for different Data Analyst job postings?**
This query identifies the highest-paying job postings by using a window function to rank salaries within each job title category, then filtering to show only the top-paying example for each role. The goal was to surface salary benchmarks across different Data Analyst positions to understand compensation potential in the field.
```sql
-- First, create a list of jobs ranked by salary within each job title category
WITH ranked_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        company_dim.name AS company_name,
        -- Critical Window Function:
        -- For each unique job title (PARTITION BY), rank all postings by salary
        -- Assigns rank=1 to the highest paying instance of each job title
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY job_title ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC) as rank
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    -- Include company names for context (LEFT JOIN preserves all jobs even if company info missing)
    LEFT JOIN 
        company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL  -- Only jobs with salary data
)

-- Final output showing only the highest-paying example of each job title
SELECT 
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    company_name
FROM 
    ranked_jobs
WHERE 
    rank = 1  -- Filter to only keep the top-paying example for each job title
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC  -- Show highest salaries first
LIMIT 10;  -- Return a manageable number of results for analysis
```
