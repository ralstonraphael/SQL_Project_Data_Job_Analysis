# üîç Background
The data analytics field has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, with organizations across all sectors recognizing the value of data-driven decision making. This project was born from my curiosity about which skills truly drive market value for data analysts, and what combination of technical competencies yields the highest returns in terms of both job security and compensation.

Data was gathered from Luke Barousse [DataNerd](https://datanerd.tech/) app that includes a large ammount of data from real data related job postings.
# üõ†Ô∏è Tools I Used
I used PostgreSQL for data analysis, writing complex queries with CTEs, window functions, and joins. VS Code helped write and debug SQL, while Tableau visualized the results in interactive dashboards.
