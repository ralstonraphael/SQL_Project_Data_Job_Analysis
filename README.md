# üìä Data Analyst Job Market Analysis
# Introduction
Welcome to my Data Analyst Job Market Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of the current data analyst job landscape, examining high-paying roles, in-demand skills, and optimal skill combinations. This project was born from my curiosity about which skills truly drive market value for data analysts, and what combination of technical competencies yields the highest returns in terms of both job security and compensationl.

# The Analysis
Each query in this project targets a distinct dimension of the data analyst job market. Here's the methodology behind each investigation:

### 1. Top Paying Remote Data Analyst Jobs
I filtered the job postings dataset for remote Data Analyst roles with valid salary data, then performed a LEFT JOIN with company information to preserve all matching records. The results were sorted by descending annual salary and limited to the top 10 highest-paying positions, extracting key fields including job details, compensation, and employer information.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,                  -- Unique identifier for each job posting
    job_title,               -- Official position title
    job_schedule_type,       -- Full-time/Part-time/Contract status
    salary_year_avg,         -- Annual compensation figure (key metric)
    job_posted_date,         -- When the position was listed
    name AS company_name     -- Employer offering the position
FROM
    job_postings_fact
-- Preserve all job postings while attaching company information
LEFT JOIN company_dim 
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND  -- Focus exclusively on Data Analyst roles
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND         -- Remote positions only
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL           -- Ensure salary data is available
-- Presentation logic:
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC                  -- Show highest salaries first
LIMIT 10;                                 -- Top 10 most lucrative opportunities
```

### 2. What skills do top-paying Data Analyst roles require?
Using a CTE to isolate top-paying roles and subsequent joins with skills tables, this query maps salary benchmarks to specific technical requirements, showing the direct relationship between compensation and skill demand in data analytics

```sql
-- First, create a temporary result set of the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst jobs
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,               -- Unique identifier for each job posting
        job_title,            -- Official job title
        salary_year_avg,      -- Annual salary figure (our key metric)
        name AS company_name  -- Company offering the position
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    -- Include company names while preserving all job postings (LEFT JOIN)
    LEFT JOIN company_dim 
        ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND  -- Focus exclusively on Data Analyst roles
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND         -- Remote positions only
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL           -- Ensure salary data exists
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC                  -- Rank by salary (highest first)
    LIMIT 10                                  -- Get the top 10 highest-paying
)

-- Main query: Retrieve skills associated with these top-paying jobs
SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,        -- Include all columns from our CTE
    skills_dim.skills         -- Add the actual skill names
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
-- Connect to skills through two joins:
-- 1. Link jobs to skill IDs (via the junction table)
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
    ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
-- 2. Map skill IDs to human-readable skill names
INNER JOIN skills_dim 
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
-- Final presentation order (highest salary first)
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### 3. Which Skills are most in demand for Data Analysts?
This query identifies and ranks the most in-demand skills for Data Analyst positions by: counting how often each skill appears in job postings, calculating its frequency as a percentage of all Data Analyst jobs, and standardizing the results on a 0-1 scale where 1 represents the most frequently required skill. It joins job posting data with skill information through bridge tables, filters for Data Analyst roles only, and returns the top 7 skills ordered by demand. The output provides both raw counts and normalized metrics to objectively compare skill importance.

```sql
-- Count how many job postings require each specific skill
WITH raw_counts AS (
    SELECT skills_dim.skills AS skill_name,
        -- Clean naming for readability
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count -- Total jobs requiring each skill
    FROM job_postings_fact
        /* Connection Path:
         1. Link job postings to skills through bridge table (skills_job_dim)
         2. Map skill IDs to actual skill names (skills_dim) */
        INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id -- Connect jobs to their skills
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id -- Get readable skill names
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' -- Focus specifically on Data Analyst roles
    GROUP BY skills_dim.skills -- Aggregate counts by each unique skill
),
total_jobs AS(
    -- Second CTE: Calculate total number of Data Analyst jobs for normalization
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT job_id) AS total
    FROM job_postings_fact
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
)
SELECT -- Main query: Combine raw counts with standardized metrics
    skill_name,
    demand_count,
    -- Percentage of all Data Analyst jobs that require this skill
    -- (Count of jobs with skill / Total jobs) * 100
    ROUND(
        demand_count * 100.0 / (
            SELECT total
            FROM total_jobs
        ),
        2
    ) AS frequency_percent,
    -- Standardized frequency (0-1 scale) where 1 = most demanded skill
    -- Current skill count / Count of most demanded skill
    ROUND(
        demand_count * 1.0 / (
            SELECT MAX(demand_count)
            FROM raw_counts
        ),
        3
    ) AS standardized_frequency
FROM raw_counts
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 7;
```

*Insert Visualization*

#### Key Insights  
- **SQL is Essential**: SQL appears in **47.12%** of Data Analyst job postings, making it the most critical skill. Its standardized frequency (1.0) sets the benchmark for all other skills.  
- **Specialization Gap**: While Python (29.16%) and Tableau (23.68%) are common, niche skills like SAS (14.28%) and R (15.30%) appear in fewer roles, highlighting optional vs. core competencies.
