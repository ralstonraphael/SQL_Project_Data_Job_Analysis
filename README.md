# The Analysis
Each query in this project targets a distinct dimension of the data analyst job market. Here's the methodology behind each investigation:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
I filtered the job postings dataset for remote Data Analyst roles with valid salary data, then performed a LEFT JOIN with company information to preserve all matching records. The results were sorted by descending annual salary and limited to the top 10 highest-paying positions, extracting key fields including job details, compensation, and employer information.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,                  -- Unique identifier for each job posting
    job_title,               -- Official position title
    job_schedule_type,       -- Full-time/Part-time/Contract status
    salary_year_avg,         -- Annual compensation figure (key metric)
    job_posted_date,         -- When the position was listed
    name AS company_name     -- Employer offering the position
FROM
    job_postings_fact
-- Preserve all job postings while attaching company information
LEFT JOIN company_dim 
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND  -- Focus exclusively on Data Analyst roles
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND         -- Remote positions only
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL           -- Ensure salary data is available
-- Presentation logic:
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC                  -- Show highest salaries first
LIMIT 10;                                 -- Top 10 most lucrative opportunities
```
